<b>Compare Discrepancy</b>:<br>ironSource and the DSP will share the number of impressions and revenues counted in the first couple of days. Once numbers align on both ends, we will have a green light to scale QPS. | DSP + IronSource
<b>Scaling Traffic</b>:<br>ironSource will inquire about the full list of countries / Mobile OS’s and QPS limitations to open traffic where you require. | DSP + IronSource
